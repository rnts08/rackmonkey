1. Introduction
===============
RackMonkey is a web-based tool for managing racks of equipment such as web
servers, video encoders, routers and storage devices. Using a simple interface 
you can keep track of what's where, which OS it runs, when it was purchased, 
who it belongs and what it's used for. No more searching for spreadsheets or 
scribbled notes when you need to find a server: RackMonkey can quickly find 
any device and draw a rack diagram of its location. RackMonkey is free and 
open source (licensed under the GPL).


2. New in this Release
